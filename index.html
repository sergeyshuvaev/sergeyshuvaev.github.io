									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have received my B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Physics from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, a premiere Russian institution for science and education.
									Besides mathematics and physics, the inderdisciplinary curriculum there has a strong focus on computer science and neuroscience, fostering scientific discovery at the interface of these fields.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>For my undergraduate research</b>, I worked with the Enikolopov lab at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology as an Abramov and Frolov Scholar.
									I have designed computer-vision models for whole-brain analysis and applied them to identify brain-wide changes in neuronal populations during brain development and neurodegenerative disease.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>During my master's</b>, I joined the Superconductivity Department at the Kurchatov Institute as an Alexandrov Scholar to complement my computational background with experience in building electrical equipment.
									As a part of this appointment, I've developed numerical models and worked towards measurements in superconductive cables to enable requirement-based design. 
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>For my doctoral studies</b>, I joined the Koulakov lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as a Swartz Fellow to pursue my interest in applying computational methods to neuroscience.
									My focus was on using machine-learning approaches, including reinforcement learning, to develop normative models of reward-driven behaviors and relate them to neuronal activity in the brain.
									
								</p>
								<p>
									I was fortunate to collaborate with amazing people.
									Our work is featured in <a href="https://nautil.us/the-doctor-will-sniff-you-now-238116/">Nautilus</a>, <a href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/a-stop-motion-movie-of-the-whole-brain-starring-new-neurons/">Spectrum</a>,

								<i>With the Koulakov Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory:</i>
								<h4>Behavior</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
											<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04285">A normative theory of social conflict (<i>arXiv</i>, 2023).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Amelchenko, E., Smagin, D., Kudryavtseva, N., Enikolopov, G., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											Chronic aggression often leads to bullying or social defeat. Why engage in such unproductive behaviors?
											We find in mice that individuals maintain beliefs about the strengths and beliefs of each other. Upon interactions, these beliefs shift, resulting in actions that ignore real strengths.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.609316/full">Neural networks with motivation (<i>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience</i>, 2021).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Tran, N., Stephenson-Jones, M., Li, B., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											To make decisions, we rely on observations, experience, and motivation. What is the computational benefit of the latter, and can we use it in machine learning?
											We find that biological motivations speed up reinforcement learning, compress the models, and enable zero-shot learning for new tasks.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/da97f65bd113e490a5fab20c4a69f586-Abstract.html">R-learning in actor-critic model offers a biologically relevant mechanism for sequential decision-making (<i>NeurIPS</i>, 2020).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.*,</b> Starosta, S.*, Kvitsiani, D., Kepecs, A., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											When do we stick to ongoing plans, and when do we seek better options? We show that such decisions flip when the perceived reward falls below its average over the recent past.
											We argue that this approach is compute-inexpensive and Bayes-optimal in ever-changing natural environments.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Olfaction</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
											<a href="https://">The primacy model and the structure of olfactory space (<i>in preparation</i>).</a><br>
											<i>Giaffar, H., <b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Rinberg, D., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											The perceived smell identity doesn't change with an increase in odor concentration despite new cells firing in the brain. How is it represented?
											We show that the odor identity is encoded in groups of first-responding cells and that the wiring of the fruit fly's brain supports the processing of this code.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/tran19b.html">DeepNose: Using artificial neural networks to represent the space of odorants (<i>ICML</i>, 2019).</a><br>
											<i>Tran, N., Kepple, D., <b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											How to predict smell knowing the molecular structure of an odorant? In human, odorants hit the smell receptors at various angles exposing various features of the molecule.
											We reproduced this scheme in a convolutional network to set the state-of-the-art for odor classification performance. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Neurodevelopment</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.16.435261v2.abstract">Encoding innate ability through a genomic bottleneck (<i>bioRxiv</i>, 2021).</a><br>
											<i>Koulakov, A., <b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Lachi, D., and Zador, A.</i><br>
											The brain wiring is specified by the genome, yet the information in the brain exceeds the genomic capacity. Here we show that such a gap -
											the genomic bottleneck - can be bridged by constraining the networks' degrees of freedom to form connectivities that are both efficient and compressible.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1706012116">Network cloning using DNA barcodes (<i>PNAS</i>, 2019).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Ba≈üerdem, B., Zador, A., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											Connections between neurons shape the experience and the innate abilities of a person. How do these connections unfold in the brain of a newborn?
											Here we propose a theoretical model for such unfolding based on "barcodes" - the unique markers tagging individual neurons with distinct labels.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<i>With the Enikolopov Lab at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology:</i>
								<h4>Neuroimaging</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016119302353">Click histochemistry for whole-mount staining of brain structures (<i>MethodsX</i>, 2019).</a><br>
											<i>Lazutkin, A., <b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> and Barykina, N.</i><br>
											Memory and cognition rely on stem cells and their division in the brain. To study stem cells across the brain, we propose using synthetic DNA "letters"
											that get into newly-divided cells and "click" to small fluorescent molecules, illuminating these cells brain-wide under 3D microscopes. 
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06871-8">Spatiotemporal 3D image registration for mesoscale studies of brain development (<i>Scientific Reports</i>, 2022).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Lazutkin, A., Kiryanov, R., Anokhin, K., Enikolopov, G., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											What changes in the brain during disease, and how do the changes evolve? Here we introduce CORGI, an algorithm to align 3D images of the brain,
											"matching" brain regions and "synchronizing" brain samples. On output, it shows time-dependent maps of changes in healthy and affected brains.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2017.00117/full">DALMATIAN: an algorithm for automatic cell detection and counting in 3D (<i>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy</i>, 2017).</a><br>
											<i><b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Lazutkin, A., Kedrov, A., Anokhin, K., Enikolopov, G., and Koulakov, A.</i><br>
											Whole-brain microscopy has become a commonplace tool, generating amounts of data far beyond the throughput of expert analysis.
											To facilitate whole-brain studies of cell populations, we introduce DALMATIAN, an automated cell detection algorithm compatible with common types of cell markers. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Neurogenesis</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>
											<a href="https://">The 3D topography and dynamics of neurogenic zones in the mouse brain (<i>in preparation</i>).</a><br>
											How to grasp the dynamics of neurogenesis? Repeated whole-brain microscopy and alignment allow reconstructing stem cell division and migration over time.
											We report new migratory paths of stem cells in the mouse brain and describe their changes from birth to adulthood.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://">The effects of Memantine, Fluoxetine on cell proliferation in adult mouse brain (<i>in preparation</i>).</a><br>
											Antidepressants and cognition-enchansing medicine operate through altering the hippocampal neurogenesis in the brain. How do they act?
											We characterize the local changes in neurogenesis caused by two popular drugs, offering a stepping stone for future studies of their function.
									</li>
									<li>
											<a href="https://journals.lww.com/neuroreport/Abstract/2019/05020/Suppressed_neurogenesis_without_cognitive.2.aspx">Suppressed neurogenesis without cognitive deficits: effects of fast neutron irradiation in mice (<i>Neuroreport</i>, 2019).</a><br>
											<i>Mineyeva, O., Barykina, N., Bezriadnov, D., Latushkin, S., Ryazanov, A., Unezhev, V., <b>Shuvaev, S.,</b> Usova, S., and Lazutkin, A.</i><br>
											Frequent flyers are exposed to fast neutron irradiation coming from cosmic rays in the Earth's magnetosphere. Does it put them at risk?
											We find that, while such irradiation does not cause memory deficit or behavior changes in mice, it suppresses the division of stem cells in their brain.
